Merge Sort vs. Bubble Sort

- Merge Sort:
  - Complexity: O(n log n) (all cases).
  - Stable and uses O(n) additional space.
  - More efficient for large datasets.

- Bubble Sort:
  - Complexity: O(nÂ²) (average/worst case).
  - Stable and uses O(1) space.
  - Inefficient for larger arrays.
